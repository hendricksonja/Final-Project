Title: Implementing and Securing a Blogging Platform

Objective: This assignment is designed to help you understand the principles of database management, SQL querying, web application development, and the fundamentals of securing applications against common vulnerabilities.

Learning Outcomes:

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

Design and implement a relational database using MySQL.
Develop a web interface using PHP to interact with the database.
Understand and apply basic security measures to protect a web application.
Identify and demonstrate SQL injection vulnerabilities and other security risks in web applications.
Project Description:

You are tasked with creating a simple blogging platform using PHP and MySQL. This platform will include user authentication, posting blog entries, and a search functionality. The platform will be built on a VirtualBox VM running Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP stack).

Tasks:

Database Setup:

Analyze and normalize the provided dataset to at least the 2nd normal form.
Create SQL scripts to generate the database schema including tables for users, posts, comments, etc.
Populate the database with initial data.

Development of PHP Web Application:

Implement PHP scripts for:
User registration and login.
Displaying all blog posts.
Adding new blog posts.
Searching for posts. 

Web Interface:

Create simple HTML forms and pages that interact with your PHP scripts.
Ensure forms are well structured and provide the necessary functionality for interacting with the database.

Security Analysis:

Examine the vulnerabilities in the provided PHP scripts, especially focusing on SQL injection.
Document how these vulnerabilities can be exploited and propose measures to mitigate these risks.
Deliverables:
Database Schema and Scripts:
SQL scripts for creating and populating database tables.
PHP Scripts:
Complete PHP scripts for handling user authentication, posting, and searching.
HTML Files:
HTML forms and pages for the functionalities implemented.
Security Report:
A detailed report that identifies vulnerabilities, describes potential exploits, and suggests mitigations.
Submission Guidelines:
Submit all your files in a compressed folder (.zip).
Include a README file detailing the structure of your project and instructions on how to set up and run your application.
Your security report should be submitted as a separate PDF document.
Evaluation Criteria:
Functionality: How well does your application perform the required tasks?
Database Design: Efficiency and normalization of the database.
Code Quality: Clarity, use of best practices, and commenting.
Security Awareness: Understanding and documentation of security vulnerabilities.
